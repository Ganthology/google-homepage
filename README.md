Google Homepage project for The Odin Project

## The first assignment: Build the Google.com homepage
I created the homepage using HTML and CSS. For the CSS part, most of the styling I used is the flex display property.
I use it to align buttons in the navigation bar, sections in the search bar, how the main content align at the center and the elements in the footer.

## The second assignment: Build the Google.com search results page
The second assignment is to recreate the Google.com search results page.
I created the page using only HTML and CSS. I use nested divisions mainly to build the website. Flexbox are also used mainly in the CSS styling. For the icons, I use the material icons provided by Google.

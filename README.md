# google-homepage
Google Homepage project for The Odin Project

## The first assignment: Build the Google.com homepage
I created the homepage using HTML and CSS. For the CSS part, most of the styling I used is the flex display property.
I use it to align buttons in the navigation bar, sections in the search bar, how the main content align at the center and the elements in the footer.
